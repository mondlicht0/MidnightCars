# MidnightWorks-TestAssigment
 
# General Information:
**Unity Version: 2022.3.31f**

**Used technologies: UniTask, Zenject (in very rare cases), Photon Fusion 2, Cinemachine, Input System**

**The game must be launched from the Boot scene**

The **_DriftGame folder** is a project folder and stores all scripts, scenes, art content, etc., that are related to the game

Save System based on JSON data persistence

# Network Engine
Photon Fusion 2

# Controls
WASD - Car Movement

# Optimization
There is no light baking in the gameplay scene (as this would take a very long time), only static objects for optimization and occlusion culling

# Ads
Only IronSource was connected as an advertising mediator

# UI
The UI menu is located in the UI Toolkit folder **(DriftGame/MainView.uxml)** of the project folder and the appropriate technology was used. The gameplay interface is based on UGUI (Canvas)

# Other
I hope the test task was completed at a fairly good level, so thank you in advance for the opportunity to complete it. 

I didnâ€™t have time to implement some things (car store, IAP store, currency exchange), that's why they're not on the menu either

Perhaps in some places it was done in a way that should not have been done (in terms of code quality, the use of singletons), I tried to complete the task in accordance with the deadline and in some places I deliberately simplified the code in order to meet the deadline. I was not familiar with Photon before, so I hope I was able to avoid obvious errors in network scripts

And dear person who checks my project, I would be glad to receive feedback on the code and the project itself in any case ðŸ™ƒ
