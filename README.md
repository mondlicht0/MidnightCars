# MidnightWorks-TestAssigment
 
# General Information:
**The game must be launched from the Boot scene**

The **_DriftGame folder** is a project folder and stores all scripts, scenes, art content, etc., that are related to the game

**Network Engine**
Photon Fusion 2 (wasn't familiar with this engine before)

**Controls:**
WASD - Car Movement

**Save System based on JSON data persistence**

**Optimization**
There is no light baking in the gameplay scene (as this would take a very long time), only static objects for optimization and occlusion culling

**Ads**
Only IronSource was connected as an advertising mediator

**UI**
The UI menu is located in the UI Toolkit folder **(DriftGame/MainView.uxml)** of the project folder and the appropriate technology was used

***I hope the test task was completed at a fairly good level, so thank you in advance for your possible participation***
