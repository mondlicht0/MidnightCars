# MidnightWorks-TestAssigment

Save System based on JSON data persistence

# Network Engine
Photon Fusion 2 (wasn't familiar with this engine before)

# Controls
WASD - Car Movement

# Optimization
There is no light baking in the gameplay scene (as this would take a very long time), only static objects for optimization and occlusion culling

# Ads
Only IronSource was connected as an advertising mediator

# UI
The UI menu is located in the UI Toolkit folder **(DriftGame/MainView.uxml)** of the project folder and the appropriate technology was used. The gameplay interface is based on UGUI (Canvas)

# Other
I hope the test task was completed at a fairly good level, so thank you in advance for the opportunity to complete it.

Perhaps in some places it was done in a way that should not have been done (in terms of code quality, the use of singletons), I tried to complete the task in accordance with the deadline and in some places I deliberately simplified the code in order to meet the deadline

And dear person who checks my project, I would be glad to receive feedback on the code and the project itself in any case ðŸ™ƒ
